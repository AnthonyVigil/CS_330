// How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
-- Reading the provided resources within the modules introduced me to skills that helped in creating the objects within the course such as a pyramid, cube, cylinder, and a plane. I also learned to add textures to the meshes on the objects to create a realistic image. Lighting tutorials were also provided; This allowed me to add spotlights to the scene and compliment the textures by reflecting or giving a depth feel.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
-- My design process involved: requirements, organization, and functionality. First I made sure to accomodate the requirements from the rubric into the project. Second, I made sure to organize the code with indentations, comments, and sorting files. Lastly, I checked the functionality by debugging and clearing any errors in the code. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
-- The design process I followed could help in future work by checking all aspects of the projects. It gives time to requirements, organization and functionality. 
How do I approach developing programs?
-- To approach developing programs, you must first determine the requirements, inputs, and outputs. What would you like to display as an output? What will the user be using to input commands? The program will also need to be tested.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
-- I used the strategy of referencing coordinates to scale and position the objects that I wanted to create. It involved much trial and error. Next, I used the textures to give it a bit of realism. The last was to include the light source so it helps with the reflection and realistic tone.
How did iteration factor into your development?
-- The iteration factor, for example for the window, allowed the program to stay on with the window and keep much of the details.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
-- My approach in developing the code evolved slowly, as I understood more of the concept I began to update the code to optimize the scene. I scrapped what I had in Module Five to begin with a new organization of the code.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-- Computer science can help me in achieving much of presentation, engineering, visualization, and optimization in most of my goals. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
-- Computational graphics and visualizations gave me the knowledge and skills to be more efficient in designing and producing better graphics for future projects.
